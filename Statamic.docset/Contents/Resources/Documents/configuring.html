<h1>Configuring</h1>

<p>All of Statamic&#8217;s configuration takes place within YAML files.
If this is your first time hearing about YAML, don&#8217;t worry.
It&#8217;s easier to pick up than one might expect.</p>

<h1>Using YAML</h1>

<p class="intro">Rhymes with "camel."</p>

<p>All configuration files for Statamic — whether for your site settings, themes you&#8217;re using, add-on configuration, or even site-specific variables — is done in YAML.
You&#8217;ll need to at least know the basics to configure your Statamic site successfully, but don&#8217;t worry, it&#8217;s pretty easy.</p>

<p>And as with most things, the more you learn about YAML and how Statamic works with it, the more you&#8217;ll be able to do, and the more enjoyable your experience will be.</p>

<h2>What is YAML?</h2>

<p>YAML is a recursive acronym that stands for <em>YAML Ain&#8217;t Markup Language</em>.
Its aim is to provide a clean, human-readable way to store data that can easily be used elsewhere.</p>

<p>Below is a small sample of YAML.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint yaml">name: "GOB Bluth"
occupation: Magician
venue: Gothic Castle
siblings:
    - Michael
    - Lindsay
    - Buster
    - Annyong
</pre>

<p>Even without knowing YAML, you might be able to grasp how data is being stored here.
The above code stores four variables: <code>name</code>, <code>occupation</code>, <code>venue</code>, and <code>siblings</code>.
The values of the first three variables are simple strings.
The last one is a simple list.</p>

<h2>How Statamic Uses YAML</h2>

<p>Statamic uses YAML in a couple of different ways.</p>

<h3>Configuring Things</h3>

<p>Statamic uses YAML to configure your main site settings, system-wide features (like <a href="advanced-features.html#routes">routes</a> and <a href="advanced-features.html#vanity-urls">vanity URLs</a>), theme-specific settings, and <a href="using-add-ons.html">add-on</a> settings.
While you probably <em>won&#8217;t</em> use them this way, all of the variables set in your site- and theme-settings become available for use as <em>tags</em> within your <a href="templating.html">templates</a>.</p>

<h3>Creating <a href="core-concepts.html#global-variables">Global Variables</a></h3>

<p>You can create any number of additional YAML files within your <code>_config</code> folder to define global variables.
These variables also are available for use as <em>tags</em> within your <a href="templating.html">templates</a>.</p>

<h3>Page-Specific Variables &amp; Settings</h3>

<p>In Statamic, the top of every content file starts with a block of YAML.
In this block (called <a href="core-concepts.html#content-files">front matter</a>), you can define page-specific variables that can be used as <em>tags</em> within your <a href="templating.html">templates</a>.</p>

<h3>Defining Fieldsets for the Control Panel</h3>

<p>You can create <em>fieldsets</em> for use in Statamic&#8217;s Control Panel so that it knows what fields each piece of content should contain, and can create an interface to let you add and edit content on the fly.</p>

<h2>Learn More About YAML</h2>

<p>Even if you don&#8217;t learn YAML, this guide will try to walk you through things as best it can, but <strong>we recommend that you learn YAML</strong>, at least a little bit.
It&#8217;s good for you, and you&#8217;ll be able to understand <em>why</em> things work, rather than just copying and pasting from our examples.
In turn, you&#8217;ll be able to do a lot more with Statamic, and you&#8217;ll have a lot more fun.</p>
