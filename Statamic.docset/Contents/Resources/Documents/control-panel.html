<div class="block content">

<h1>What It Is</h1>

<p class="intro">Update your site from anywhere.</p>

<p>Statamic&#8217;s Control Panel lets you maintain content and update your site from a web-based interface.
Your Control Panel is part of your site&#8217;s installation â€” it comes as part of Statamic&#8217;s core package.</p>

<p>The Control Panel is also responsive, and has been tested to work with many different devices.
If you&#8217;re using a phone, computer, or browser released within the last five years, you should be able to access the entire Control Panel without a problem.</p>

<h2>Two Ways to Update Your Site</h2>

<p>Statamic has been designed in a way that maintaining your content via text files should be easy and straight-forward.
However, we understand that not everyone wants to be fiddling with files all the time, so the Control Panel is a nice secondary way to create content.</p>

<p>The Control Panel is not required to use Statamic, and can be <a href="#removing">completely removed</a> without issue.</p>

</div>

<a id="fields-and-fieldsets" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2. Fields & Fieldsets" class="dashAnchor"></a>
<div class="block content">

<h1>Fields & Fieldsets</h1>

<p class="intro">Defining the fields you wish to use per folder.</p>

<p>Statamic lets you define fields in arrangements called <em>fieldsets</em>.
You then tell Statamic which content uses which fieldset, and the Control Panel builds out the appropriate form for you.</p>

<h2>Fieldsets</h2>

<p>A <em>fieldset</em> is a simple YAML file that defines a list of fields.
Your fieldsets are kept in the <code>_config/fieldsets</code> folder.
A fieldset file consists of a single top-level key (<code>fields</code>), and allows you to set and configure any number of content fields utilizing any combination of the available <a href="">fieldtypes</a>.</p>

<p>An example of what a fieldset might look like:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint yaml">fields:
    description:               ## the template tag, i.e. {{ description }}
        display: Description   ## the Control Panel field label (optional)
        required: false        ## true/false for validation (optional)
        default:               ## default value (optional)
        type: redactor         ## fieldtype (optional, text by default)
        instruction: Write!    ## instructional text
    author:
        display: Author
        required: true
        default: Bear Grylls
        type: users
</pre>

<h3>Naming Fields</h3>

<p>You can name your fields any way you choose but each field name needs to be unique and you can not use a hyphen to separate names, underscores are allowed.</p>

<h3>Using Fieldsets</h3>

<p>To assign a fieldset to a piece of content, use the <code>_fieldset</code> setting in your front matter.
For example, want a page to use the fieldset located in <code>_config/fieldsets/page.yaml</code>?
Add this to the front matter:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint yaml">_fieldset: page</pre>

<p>Additionally, you may use the Fieldset selector in the Control Panel by simply clicking <em>New Page</em> in the Pages view.</p>

<h2>Fieldsets for Entries</h2>

<p>Entries are unique in that they consist of an entire folder full of similarly structured content files, all sharing the same fields and defaults.
In order to make a fieldset globally available for an entire Entry type, you place a <code>fields.yaml</code> file into the folder with either the desired fieldtype to use, or a one-off fields configuration.
In other words, you can set your fieldset right on the spot, or re-use any set you&#8217;ve created already.</p>

<h3>Entry Type</h3>

<p>There are currently two types of entries: <em>date</em> and <em>number</em>. Date entries are date-based, with URLs beginning with a year-month-day datestamp (e.g. <code>2013-07-04-fireworks.md</code>).
Number entries are entries that begin with a numeral, used to optionally indicate their manual sort order in any given listing.</p>

<p>To determine the ordering mechanism for a folder&#8217;s entries, set the <code>type</code> setting in that folder&#8217;s <code>fields.yaml</code>.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint yaml">type: date|number</pre>

<h2>Advanced Fieldset Techniques</h2>

<p>These are <em>advanced</em> in the sense that they take slightly more configuration.
Advanced functionality, simple implementation.</p>

<h3>Extending Fieldsets</h3>

<p>Your fieldsets can also include other fieldsets.
This becomes useful if you want to reuse a certain combination of fields (for example, meta-data) in multiple fieldsets.
To do this, use the <code>include</code> setting at the root level of your fieldset:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint yaml">fields:
    ## fields you define
include:
    - meta-data
</pre>

<p>Additionally, you can set multiple fieldsets right in your content fields.
This is an advanced solution, as fieldsets are not changeable in the Control Panel (as a measure to preserve your content).</p>

<pre class="prettyprint yaml">---
title: Bears! Bears Everywhere!
_fieldset:
    - meta
    - main-content
</pre>

<h3>Naming Fieldsets</h3>

<p>Your fieldset might need a better name than the filename you&#8217;ve chosen.
In this situation, just add a <code>title</code> option to your fieldset&#8217;s root.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint yaml">title: Standard Page</pre>

<h3>Hiding Fieldsets</h3>

<p>Sometimes you don&#8217;t want to show all fieldsets in your Control Panel (because remember, a content creator can choose from your fieldsets when they click <em>New Page</em> in the Control Panel).
For this, you can hide a fieldset from the <em>New Page</em> list with the following:</p>

<pre class="prettyprint yaml">hide: true</pre>

</div>

<a id="fieldtypes" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3. Fieldtypes" class="dashAnchor"></a>
<div class="block content">

<h1>Fieldtypes</h1>

<p class="intro">Create different types of fields.</p>

<p>Statamic comes with a hearty set of fieldtypes that you can choose from when creating your <a href="#fields-and-fieldsets">fieldsets</a>.
A <em>fieldtype</em> defines what a field will look like in the Control Panel, as well as how the data for that field will be saved in your content file&#8217;s <a href="core-concepts.html#content-files">YAML front-matter</a>.</p>

<p>Each fieldtype comes with its own configuration options and instructions, so be sure to consult the complete list of first-party fieldtypes in the <a href="documentation/fieldtypes.html">documentation</a>.</p>

<h2>Third-Party Fieldtypes</h2>

<p>Fieldtypes are also one of the things that can be <a href="creating-add-ons.html">created as an add-on</a>.
This means that if you can&#8217;t find a fieldtype that does what you want, you can always make your own.</p>

</div>

<a id="managing-content" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/4. Managing Content" class="dashAnchor"></a>
<div class="block content">

<h1>Managing Content</h1>

<p class="intro">Update your site.</p>

<p>All of the content in your site can be reached and managed in the &#8220;Content&#8221; area of the control panel.
The initial view presents you with an easy-to-understand &#8220;Page Tree&#8221; of your site&#8217;s page structure.
Each existing page can be clicked or tapped to edit its respective content.
All listings are shown in-line with their parent page/section (as long as a <code>fields.yaml</code> file is configured in that folder), along with the options to either &#8220;List Entries&#8221; or &#8220;Create Entry.&#8221;</p>

<p>You can also create Pages by clicking the &#8220;Add Page&#8221; button, and choosing from your available and configured <a href="#fields-and-fieldsets">fieldsets</a>.</p>

<h2>List Entries</h2>

<p>Each entries list will show you all the entries, their slug, status, and date or order, depending on the type of entry.
Each column is sortable by clicking or tapping on the column header.
Entries can be edited by clicking or tapping their title, or deleted with the trashcan icon.</p>

<p>In order to gain access to the List Entries controls, a <code>fields.yaml</code> file is required to be set for that given folder.</p>

<h3>Statuses</h3>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Live:</strong> URL is accessible on the site, visible in <code>{{ nav }}</code> tags</li>
	<li><strong>Hidden:</strong> URL is accessible on the site, hidden from <code>{{ nav }}</code> tags</li>
	<li><strong>Draft:</strong> URL is not accessible on the site, hidden from <code>{{ nav }}</code> tags</li>
</ul>

<h2>Create Entry</h2>

<p>Creating an entry will publish a new entry in the desired section.
You will have access to all the content fields in the section&#8217;s <code>fields.yaml</code> file.
When creating new entries, a suggested slug will automatically be generated for you based on your <code>title</code> field, but feel free to change it.</p>

<p>In order to gain access to the Create Entry controls, a <code>fields.yaml</code> file is required to be set for that given folder.</p>

</div>

<a id="managing-members" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/5. Managing Members" class="dashAnchor"></a>
<div class="block content">

<h1>Managing Members</h1>

<p class="intro">Control who can use the Control Panel</p>

<p>Each member account is simply a YAML file contained in the <code>/_config/users</code> folder.
The username is the name the file (ending with <code>.yaml</code>), and all the member details are Content Fields (YAML Front Matter), followed by a Bio field, very much like Pages and Entries&#8217; content field.</p>

<p>Your first account is already setup for you, but you can feel free to modify and remove it altogether.
Simply rename the <code>admin.yaml.sample</code> file to admin.yaml.
You&#8217;ll need to set a password and login to have the password encrypted automatically.</p>

<pre class="prettyprint yaml">---
first_name: User
last_name: McAwesome
roles: [admin]
password:
---
User McAwesome is a secret agent, currently undercover as a wilderness
survival guide.  We trust you will keep this information under wraps.
</pre>

<p>The fields inside your member accounts are completely up to you, though we&#8217;ve set a few defaults.</p>

<p>Inside the control panel you have the ability to create member accounts, update information, change passwords, and so on.</p>

<h2>Roles</h2>

<p>Roles exist to limit what particular members have access to.
At the moment, the only role you can choose from is &#8220;admin&#8221;.
Members with the &#8220;admin&#8221; role will be able to access the control panel, and those without it will not.</p>

<p>Members without the &#8220;admin&#8221; role can still log in on the front-end of the site, which is useful for protecting pages and/or content from the casual passer-by.</p>

<div class="block content">

<h1>Removing the Control Panel</h1>

<p class="intro">Get rid of your Control Panel.</p>

<p>The Control Panel is not required to use Statamic, and can be completely removed from your installation.
To do so, you&#8217;ll want to delete the following from the root of your Statamic install:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>admin</code> folder</li>
<li>The <code>admin.php</code> file</li>
</ul>

<p>Also, you should disable the admin interface all together via your <a href="../configuring/control-panel-settings.html">settings file</a>.
Open <code>_config/settings.yaml</code>, and set <code>_admin_enabled</code> to <code>false</code>.</p>

</div>

<a id="dashboard" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/7. Using the Dashboard" class="dashAnchor"></a>
<div class="block content">

<h1>Using the Dashboard</h1>

<p class="intro">Welcome your site administrators.</p>

<p>The Control Panel comes with an optional and customizable <em>dashboard</em> that you can use to greet site admins.
It&#8217;s turned off by default, but you can enable it, choose it as the start page, and add whatever HTML you&#8217;d like to it rather easily.</p>

<h2>Turning It On</h2>

<p>Open up your <a href="configuring.html#general-site-settings">general site settings</a> file, and follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Find the <code>_admin_nav</code> list</li>
<li>Set <code>dashboard</code> to <code>true</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Setting It as the Start Page</h2>

<p>Open up your <a href="configuring.html#general-site-settings">general site settings</a> file, and follow this step:</p>

<ol>
<li>Set <code>_admin_start_page</code> to <code>dashboard</code></li>
</ol>

<h2>Editing Dashboard Content</h2>

<p>In your <code>_config</code> folder you should find a <code>dashboard.yaml</code> file.
Within this file are two variables: <code>dashboard_main_content</code> and <code>dashboard_sidebar_content</code>.
Edit these with whatever HTML you&#8217;d like to show up on the dashboard.</p>
