<h1>Choosing a License</h1>

<p class="intro">When to use which license.</p>

<p>Statamic has two licenses available for purchase: <em>personal</em> and <em>professional</em>.
Buying either of these licenses will give you access to the same full-version of Statamic, the only difference being the level of the license key generated.</p>

<h2>Which One Do I Need?</h2>

<p>The type of license that you&#8217;ll need depends on how you plan to use Statamic.</p>

<h3>Professional License (You probaby need this one)</h3>

<p>A professional license is intended to be used in all standard and commercial scenarios.
If the site is going to be used in anyway that&#8217;s related to people trying to make money, you&#8217;ll want this license.
Some examples:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A company&#8217;s site (either for-profit or not-for-profit)</li>
	<li>A start-up&#8217;s blog</li>
	<li>A site for a church</li>
	<li>A résumé/portfolio site (if you&#8217;re your own business)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Personal License</h3>

<p>A personal license is intended for use in a person, non-commercia situation.
Some examples of where a personal license is okay:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A personal blog (assuming you don&#8217;t make or intend to make a living off of it)</li>
	<li>A school project</li>
	<li>A family newsletter</li>
	<li>A hobby site</li>
	<li>A résumé/portfolio site (if you&#8217;re applying for jobs)</li>
</ul>

<h2>I&#8217;m Still Not Sure</h2>

<p>If the above examples didn&#8217;t help you, <a href="mailto:gentlemen@statamic.com?subject=Which license is right for me?">just ask</a>!
We want you to know that the money made from license sales not only keeps our lights on, it also pays the team that builds Statamic, handles support requests, does all the heavy-lifting to make Statamic great, and funds our jerky addiction.</p>

<h2>Upgrading or Transferring a License</h2>

<p>Licenses cannot be upgraded or transferred to another person or company at this time.</p>

	<h1>Server Requirements</h1>

<p class="intro">What your server needs to run Statamic.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t take much to run Statamic on your server.
Your server will need the following things:</p>

<ul>
	<li>PHP 5.3+, compiled with the <code>mcrypt</code> extension</li>
	<li><code>mod_rewrite</code> (or your server&#8217;s equivalent)</li>
</ul>

</div>

<a id="checking-your-server" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/3. Checking Your Server" class="dashAnchor"></a>

<div class="block content">

<h1>Checking Your Server</h1>

<p class="intro">Can your server handle Statamic?</p>

<p>We&#8217;ve created a <a href="https://github.com/statamic/Check">server check file</a> that will determine if your server is capable of running Statamic.
To use the check file:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download the free check file from <a href="https://github.com/statamic/Check">the GitHub repository</a></li>
<li>Upload <code>check.php</code> to your server</li>
<li>Visit <code>check.php</code> in your browser</li>
</ol>

<p>You should see the result of the check, including anything that&#8217;s missing.
In some circumstances, the check file might say that the status of something is <em>unknown</em>.
Know that here, &#8220;unknown&#8221; truly means unknown.
It means that the check file wasn&#8217;t able to get a definitive answer about a particular feature, but your server may still support it (and Statamic may still work).</p>
