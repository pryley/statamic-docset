    		<h1>Welcome to Statamic</h1>

        <p>This docset is your complete guide to the world of Statamic.</p>
        <p>Statamic is a flat-file content management system that makes mixing static and dynamic elements simple (and, dare we say, fun).
It&#8217;s built on PHP, but you don&#8217;t need to know or write any PHP to use it.
It takes very little to run, and we think you&#8217;re going to love it.</p>

<p><strong>Statamic is <em>not</em> a static-site generator.</strong>
It&#8217;s live, quick, and dynamic.</p>

<h3>Guides</h3>

<p>The <em>Guides</em> are intended to be narrative â€” something you can start at the beginning and read straight through to the end, or you can skip around.
When you&#8217;re done, you should have a good idea of what Statamic is, how it works, and how to build some amazing things.</p>

<p>Included is also a <a href="cheat-sheet.html">cheat sheet</a> guide that lists of all the tags, parameters and variables available for Statamic. You can view this as a <a href="http://statamic.github.io/statamic-cheat-sheet">github page</a>, feel free to fork and add a pull request.</p>

<h3>Everything Else</h3>

<p>The rest of this docset is more technical and include complete explanations of all of Statamic&#8217;s moving parts.
It's a reference as to what&#8217;s possible with the core product itself.</p>

<h2>A Work in Progress</h2>

<p>Undertaking a complete overhaul of this area is a big undertaking, and we don&#8217;t expect to nail it on the first try.
(We&#8217;ve certainly tried, but we&#8217;re also realistic.)
If you find an error on any page, please let us know.
We&#8217;ve even included a quick link at the bottom of each page to send us an email.</p>
